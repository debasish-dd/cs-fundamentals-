# Kernel in Operating System
Kernel is a core compunent in OS. It manages softwere and hardware in a computer.

- Facilitates communication between hardware and software.
- Ensure efficient and smooth multitasking 
- Manage system stability and prevents unauthorized resource access.
## Types of Kernel
### 1. Monolithic Kernel :
Here all operating system services operate in **kernel space**. It has dependencies between systems components. It has huge lines of code which is complex.
- **Advantages :** Efficient, Tight Integration, low latency, simple .
- **Disadvantages :** Security Vulnerabilities, Stability issue, Maintenance Difficulties.

### 2. Micro Kernel :
These types of kernels has simple approach, it has virtual memory & thread scheduling. It has less services in kernel space. It puts rest in user space.
 - **Advantages :** Reliability, Flexibility , Modularity.
 - **Disadvantages :** Low Performance, Complex ,Development Difficulty, Higher Resource Usage.

 ### 3. Hybrid Kernel :
 It is the combination of both monolithic kernel and microkernel. It has the speed and performance of monolithic kerner and modularity of microkernel.

  - **Advantages :** Performance, Compatibility, Flexibility, Reliability.
  - **Disadvantages :** Compeixity,less secure, Maintenance, Resource Usage.

  ## 4. Exo Kernel :
  These type of kernel which follows end-to-end principle. It has fewest hardware abstractions as possible. It allocates physical resources to applications.

   - **Advantages:** Flexibility, Performance, Security, Modularity.
   - **Disadvantages:** Complexity, Development Difficulty, Limited Support.

   ### 5. Nano Kernel :
   It is the type of kernel that offers hardware abstraction but without system services. Micro Kernel also does not have system services therefore the Micro Kernel and Nano Kernel have become analogous.
   
   - **Advantages :** small size, High Modularity, secure,Portability
   - **Disadvantages :** Limited Functionality, Complexity, Performance, Compatibility
